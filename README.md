## COVID19 Map  - PWA system

For this challenge I used Laravel 10, React, Tailwind 3, InertiaJs and Datamaps.

This system can be installed as PWA (Progress web application) in your desktop or mobile device.

## Laravel 10 Install

```sh
composer install
yarn install
```

Configure your env. file with your local database credentials and local server address.

## Migrate and seed data

```sh
php artisan migrate
php artisan db:seed
```

## Running services

```sh
php artisan serve
yarn dev
```

## Running services
```sh
http://localhost:8000
Default user: admin@admin.com
Default password: 12345678
```
